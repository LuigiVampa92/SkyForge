<p>This Android Studio plugin allows you to move high CPU and RAM-consuming Gradle builds of Android projects to a remote server and utilize its resources instead of your local machine. If you work on a weak workstation, like a tiny laptop, then this can greatly boost your performance. You will also experience much less fan noise and overheating. Just turn on the remote builds mode and let the server do all the hard work. You can fall back to local builds mode any time you want, for example, if your server is currently unavailable or you are outside of network coverage. Set up the server connection configuration in plugin settings once and reuse it for any of your Android Studio projects, any time you want.

Features:
<ul>
    <li>Windows, Linux, and MacOS support</li>
    <li>Seamless integration with the Android Studio graphical user interface. No special manual commands or scripts are needed. Just turn on the remote builds mode and use the "Run" and "Debug" buttons as usual. You can use Debugger to debug apps on your USB-connected devices, etc.</li>
    <li>UI is completely native, IDE works on your local computer, not on the server. No network lag for the UI. Low dependency on network quality and stability</li>
    <li>No project source code modification is required. You don't need to add any Gradle build plugins, rewrite configs, etc</li>
    <li>You can quickly switch between build modes on a local machine or on a remote server with a single button click</li>
    <li>If your project contains dependencies that are pulled from your company's private Maven or Nexus repositories located inside your company's VPN, you can easily access them on your server by configuring proxy tunnels to your local machine</li>
</ul>
